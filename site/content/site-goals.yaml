goals:
  - name: Professional Portfolio
    description: >
      Showcase cloud architecture, DevOps, and AI expertise through
      real project case studies and technical writing.

  - name: Builder Identity
    description: >
      Demonstrate building, not just advising. The site itself is a
      portfolio piece. From the SvelteKit framework to the AI-powered
      features, every technical choice is intentional and visible.

  - name: Thought Leadership
    description: >
      Share technical insights via blog posts and project narratives.
      Go beyond "what was built" to cover the why and how behind
      architectural decisions.

  - name: Range & Versatility
    description: >
      Show the full spectrum. Enterprise engagements (Discover Financial,
      Gordon Food Service, AWS), community work (Fairview Children's Center),
      and entrepreneurship (Fill In My Blank). Technical depth across
      cloud, DevOps, platform engineering, and product development.

  - name: Human Connection
    description: >
      Go beyond resume bullets to show how Brian works with people
      and approaches problems. Each project should convey voice,
      context, and lessons learned, not just deliverables.
