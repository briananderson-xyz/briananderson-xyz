## The Challenge
For a global financial leader like **Discover**, the challenge was developer friction. Scaling thousands of microservices required a standardized way to deploy safely without sacrificing velocity.

## What I Built
I focused on the **integration side of the Trident pipeline**, focusing on creating "Golden Paths" for internal engineering teams.

- **Golden Paths:** Established pre-approved, "best practice" deployment patterns that baked in security and compliance by default.
- **Integration Logic:** Built the modular automation and API layers that allowed diverse product teams to onboard onto the Trident framework.
- **Kubernetes Abstraction:** Created tooling to simplify the developer experience, moving the focus from "how to deploy" to "what to build."

## Key Outcomes
- **Velocity:** Reduced deployment lead time by **90%** for teams adopting the new pipeline.
- **Scale:** Successfully standardized delivery for hundreds of internal engineering squads.
- **Reliability:** Improved the security posture by enforcing "compliance-as-code" within every build.
