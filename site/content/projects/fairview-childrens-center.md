### The Project
Melissa reached out because she needed help making a few updates to her website. I teamed up with my sister Jennifer, a UX researcher whose child attends the center, to put together a proposal after showing Melissa some of the missed opportunities her site had in reaching prospective parents.

## The Challenge
I gave the website a full UI overhaul with the help of Gemini 3. I've always been interested in working on a WordPress theme but hadn't spent much time in that ecosystem before. Given my history with front-end development, I embraced the challenge. I love learning new tech, and it didn't take long to get a full grasp on the platform.

### Timeline
**January 2025 - February 2025**

## What I Built
It didn't take long to get all the updates Melissa wanted, while also making sure the site was built to be manageable long-term.

### Technical Specs
- **Platform:** WordPress
- **Theme:** Brand new custom theme, page hierarchy, and menus (including mobile)
- **Design:** Strategic UI overhaul focusing on clear Call to Actions rather than "walls of text"
- **Tooling:** Leveraged Gemini 3 for the redesign process

### New Functionality
- **FAQ & News:** Added a dedicated FAQ page and a News section where Melissa can create and categorize posts herself.
- **Meet Our Team:** A new page featuring staff pictures to help parents get to know the center.
- **Custom Navigation:** A complete restructure of the menus to make the site easier to navigate on any device.

## Under the Hood
I also handled a lot of the technical debt that had piled up over the years:
- **Infrastructure:** Upgraded the site to the latest PHP version.
- **Security:** Cleaned up security gaps by removing many old, unused user accounts.
- **Optimization:** Sunsetted problematic plugins to reduce the overhead for future upgrades.
- **Staging Workflow:** I enabled a staging site (which she was already paying for but not using). This allowed us to showcase the work in progress and, more importantly, gave Melissa a safe place to try out updates without being scared of breaking the live production environment.

## Knowledge Handoff
I didn't want to just finish the site and leave Melissa hanging. I took the time to record knowledge handoffs so she knows exactly how to maintain the site. By showing her a workflow that allows her to sync from staging to production, she can now manage her site with confidence.
